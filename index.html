  <h1>Transit Oriented Development and Gentrification in the NoHo Arts District, From 2000 to 2019</h1>
  <p>
    North Hollywood has always been a creative melting pot for artists of all backgrounds. Many of the world's most famous albums were recorded here, such as Metallica's Black Album. Artists from other countries want a part of what makes North Hollywood special, such as Yoshiki Hayashi of X Japan; K-pop stars train at Millennium Dance Complex, to emulate Britney Spears and other popstars who trained there. Modern celebrities had their start here, such as Doja Cat and Jeffree Star. When asked if Hetfield (co-founder of Metallica) liked recording in North Hollywood, he responded with, "No, it's too easy to have fun here." <a href="https://patch.com/california/northhollywood/recorded-in-noho-metallica-s-black-album">(Clough, Craig-Recorded in NoHo: Metallica's Black Album, 2011)</a> Now, things are changing. Millenium Dance Complex was forced to move to Studio City as its former space was transformed into a mixed-use development. This has become a recurring theme in North Hollywood. People and businesses, North Hollywood's culture and history, are being displaced and replaced with bland and unsustainable developments.

    "Transit Oriented Development is the exciting fast growing trend in creating vibrant, livable, sustainable communities. Also known as TOD, it's the creation of compact, walkable, pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use communities centered around high quality train systems. This makes it possible to live a lower-stress life without complete dependence on a car for mobility and survival.<br>
    Transit oriented development is regional planning, city revitalization, suburban renewal, and walkable neighborhoods combined. TOD is rapidly sweeping the nation with the creation of exciting people places in city after city. The public has embraced the concept across the nation as the most desirable places to live, work, and play. <b>Real estate developers have quickly followed to meet the high demand for quality urban places served by rail systems.</b><br>
    Transit oriented development is also a major solution to the serious and growing problems of climate change and global energy security by creating dense, walkable communities that greatly reduce the need for driving and energy consumption. <b>This type of living arrangement can reduce driving by up to 85%.</b>" <a href="http://www.tod.org/">(Transit Oriented Development Institute)</a><br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Transit oriented development and real estate developers are strongly associated; so much so that the governing body responsible for TOD in the US highlights them in their definition, in a commending fashion. They claim that TOD can reduce driving by "up to" 85%, but how much has it reduced driving in the NoHo Arts District? Judging by the map below, not much! An overwhelming majority of workers still commute by car.

    North Hollywood Station opened in 2000, with bus terminals, and a Red Line (subway) stretching to Union Station. In 2005, the Orange Line was opened, which provided a busway connecting North Hollywood to the rest of the valley. This solidified North Hollywood as the transit hub of the San Ferando Valley. Below is a visual representation of the Red and Orange lines.

    This frequency chart was derived from "a systematic review of 35 quantitative research-based studies presenting evidence on gentrification outcomes resulting from transit-based interventions." <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2019.1649316">(Padeiro, Miguel-Transit-Oriented Development and Gentrification: A Systematic Review, 2019)</a> We use this as a basis for the importance of topics when studying our area of interest. For our story map, we define gentrification as "a process of neighborhood change that includes economic change in a historically disinvested neighborhood – by means of real estate investment and new higher-income residents moving in – as well as demographic change – not only in terms of income level, but also in terms of changes in the education level or racial make-up of residents.” <a href="https://youtu.be/V0zAvlmzDFc">(Urban Displacement Project-Gentrification Explained, 2017)</a><br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Gentrification occurred in the NoHo Arts District after the opening of North Hollywood Station; we seek to highlight how this affected the NoHo Arts District and its residents, both past and present. The NoHo Arts District is composed of six census tracts: 1253.10, 1253.20, 1254.01, 1255.01, 1254.02 and 1255.02. We hope our findings lead to policies that curtail displacement and the affordability crisis in areas penetrated by transit oriented development.
